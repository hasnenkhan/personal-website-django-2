                            <u>CONCEPT OF POWER FOR BEGINNERS</u>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="cop-body">
                            <p>For ages, Power as a concept has been highly debated and contested. Politics is all about Power,
                                 and the practice of politics is often portrayed as little more than the exercise of Power.
                                  While studying politics, we often seek the answers to a few questions, such as who has it, how it is used,
                                 how it is exercised, how to acquire it, whether it is evenly distributed or concentrated, and many more.
                            </p>
                            <p>The term ‘POWER’ can be defined in numerous ways. For example, in science, it is often understood as energy.
                                 In contrast, in social sciences, it is loosely understood as the ability to influence other 
                                 people or government or law, or civil society. It is also understood as the capacity to take some decision and implement
                                  it successfully by controlling people or using external methods. Some relevant examples from our day-to-day 
                                  life are the Power of parents over children, masters over enslaved people, owners over workers, government
                                   over citizens, etc. Power is a feature of our society.
                            </p>
                            <p>A perfectly acceptable definition of Power that can encompass all its various manifestations:if A gets B to do something
                                 A wants but which B would not have chosen to do, Power is being exercised. In other words, Power is the 
                                 ability to get someone to do what they would not otherwise have done.So,Power can be said to have three faces.
                                 First,it can involve the ability to influence the making of decisions; second, it may prevent decisions from being made;
                                 andthird, it may take the form of controlling people’s thoughts by manipulating their perceptions and 
                                 preferences.
                            </p>
                            <p>Power can sometimes be termed as possession reflected through the control of wealth, political position, social status,
                                and sometimes class or caste. And from here comes the term ‘ruling elites.’ The time ‘ruling elites’ stands for a group
                                of privileged people in society who acquires the Power to influence the decision of the whole community or sometimes
                                thestate.Sometimes it also happens that a group may gain some power but choose not to use it because they do not
                                anticipate that the decisions made will adversely affect them. For example, private businesses
                                may show little interest in health, housing, and education – unless increased welfare spending threatens to push up taxes.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Marxist theory views Power as distributed unequally in a class-divided society, such as a capitalist society,
                                 where the ruling classes own the means of production and exercise Power over the working class, which holds no property,
                                 but produces surplus value through its labor power that the capitalist appreciates. Feminist theory
                                understands Power as located with in structures of patriarchy, which ensures that there is systematic domination
                                of women by men. In both views, Power seems to be situated in the system, and individuals derive Power from the
                                irpositions.The same applies to a dominant-class society where the upper class oppresses and
                                exploits the lower class. The upper class gets the authority to exercise this Power because of the class
                                structure prevalent in the society or sometimes caste structure.
                            </p>
                            <p>In a liberal democratic system, political groups often act as interest groups, favoring the articulation of 
                                specific views and interests while restricting the expression of others. And presently, looking at the
                                situation of our own country India,we can’t get a better example of such interest groups.
                                 People in our society might not even know their minds because they have the habit of getting influenced.
                                  Ordinary people have always been the victim of class exploitation and oppression within which Power is 
                                  concentrated in the hands of a ‘ruling class, the bourgeoisie. In Marx’s view, any society's dominant 
                                  ideas, values, and beliefs are the ideas of its ruling class. Thus the exploited class, the 
                                  proletariat, is deluded by the weight of bourgeois ideas. Lukes’s solution to this problem is to suggest
                                   that people’s fundamental interests are‘what they would want and prefer were they able to make a choice.
                                    In other words, only rational and autonomous individuals can identify their own ‘real’ interests.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The exercise of Power is traditionally linked to politics, but when narrowed down, another term comes,
                                 ‘authority’ often termed as ‘political authority. Power and authority are often understood as synonyms,
                                  but there is a slight difference between the two. Power is the ability to influence society, whereas
                                authority is the right to control. Power brings about compliance through persuasion, pressure, threats,
                                 coercion, or violence. On the other hand,authority is based upon a perceived ‘right to rule’ and brings
                                  about compliance through a moral obligation on the part of the ruled to obey.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Coming to persuasion is an effective and widely used means of influencing the behavior of another. We
                                 can’t get a better example of effectiveness than electoral politics. Electoral politics is all about
                                  persuasion through different methods- political parties campaign, advertise and organize meetings and 
                                 rallies, hoping to influence voters on Election Day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At last, Power is central to the understanding and practice of politics, and it can be exercised on 
                                three levels: 
                            </p>
                            <ul style="text-align:left;">
                                <li>through the ability to make or influence decisions;</li>
                                <li> through the ability to set the agenda and prevent decisions from being made;</li>
                                <li>and through the ability to manipulate what people think and want.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Politics is all about power, and our everyday life is all related to politics</p>

                       <u>CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FILM "BANDIT QUEEN”</u>
                    </div> 

                    <div class="cop-body">
                        <p>
                            The movie ‘’Bandit Queen’’ has been Located at the intersection of gender, caste, and class oppression which women,
                             particularly in rural India as well as in urban spheres, have been continuously subjected to face for centuries 
                             and are still facing. Transcending through these atrocities majority of her life, since the very inception of 
                             her womanhood as a woman trapped in the complexities, Phoolan Devi has come to symbolize an extreme, not
                              necessarily of oppression but of contestation.Shekhar Kapur's film Bandit Queen came in 1994 as a story of
                               oppression and revenge plotted neatly on the grid of gender and caste.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Until recently, the average Indian's knowledge of Phoolan Devi came from her constructions in the print media 
                            over the years that she was the product of the arid, rocky Chambal Valley which straddles the Indian states of
                             Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and which has historically been the cradle of dacoits or armed bandits; 
                             that she controlled the area with her daring exploits, murdering, looting and occasionally playing Robin Hood,
                              eluded the two State governments until she was persuaded to surrender voluntarily in early 1983 After that
                               she was subsequently forced to serve a long prison term. The woman behind all this publicity assumed a 
                               recognizable shape only after her release from jail in 1994, as well as with the projection of her
                                life in the movie Bandit Queen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The question here is how the film has shaped the identity of Phoolan Devi? I want to dive deeper into the
                             ways and notions around which the depiction of the personality of Phoolan Devi has been done in the movie
                              Bandit Queen. Shekhar Kapur's storytelling is gripping enough to keep you going for two hours. I was
                               left asking for more toward the end, though. It was an underwhelming end to a roaring start. Or was it
                                the over-emphasis on the rape-and-retribution theme? Or, Eventually, was it the material that needed
                                 to be produced for the average Indian audience along with the notion of gazing at a rape victim? I
                                  will like to address the question of the portrayal of subaltern third-world women as the mute bearers
                                   of violence as a means of invested interest and material of consumption for the western world as
                                    this film has been directed with the collaboration of a British production company, even scripted
                            by a British journalist Mala Sen based on her book "India's Bandit Queen: The True Story of Phoolan Devi",
                            which she wrote after having several interviews with Phoolan Devi while she was serving her punishment in
                            Jail. As the film had colossal reception across western audiences, the film premiered in the Directors’
                            Fortnight section of the 1994 Cannes Film Festivals and was screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival.
                            That year, the film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi and Filmfare Critics Award
                            for Best Movie and Best Direction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am trying to say here that the film's reception has certainly been different across these two worlds.
                            But the larger audience of the film was the Indian middle class which always sees rape victims with social 
                            stigmas of victimhood and sympathy, which is the same thing that happened in the character of Phoolan Devi 
                            in this film. She has been portrayed more as a victim than a female who is assertive and resentful against 
                            the atrocities carried out with her at various stages of her life as a woman. Kapur’s projection of Phoolan 
                            Devi's character resonates with the idea of the patriarchal reaction of men who find it impossible to recognize 
                            a woman’s agency of self-assertion. They will always treat it as circumstantial, personal revenge, or anything 
                            that will take away the notion of a revolutionary form of assertion. There is a quote from her autobiography 
                            that I found very relevant to show how she became a woman of her choice, assertion, and resentment from the 
                            very beginning. "The poor must bow down and touch the feet of the rich. The poor eat a few grains of millet 
                            while the rich feast on mangoes. The pain of hunger in the belly of the poor produces fear and submission. 
                            I tried to submit, as my father said I should, but I was unable. I was like my mother. There was too much 
                            anger in me."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At one level,  the film signifies "strategies of invested representation" that fit terms of the Western 
                            consumption of the heroic representation of a third-world woman against her oppressions while at the same 
                            time keeping the needs of a larger audience at the center of the portrayal of the woman character. This is 
                            what visual media does; It transforms the whole narrative around a personality by merely depicting the things 
                            suited for the cultural consumption of the audience.In the national public sphere in India, the film Bandit 
                            Queen sparked a contentious and distinctive debate on the politics of authenticity, authority, and 
                            responsibility in representing the problems and struggles of an individual, particularly a female from a 
                            minority group. The controversy centered on the politics of gender and sexuality since director Kapur presents 
                            various scenes of rapes, one of which is a gang rape of Phoolan Devi. This touched a raw nerve of public 
                            (middle-class) morality within the Indian public sphere. The film underwent a significant battle against 
                            censorship with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), the Supreme Court of India, and the Delhi 
                            High Court due to the petition filed by the Gujjar community and a petition filed by Phoolan Devi herself 
                            against the director of the film for misrepresentation of various facts about Phoolan Devi’s own life.
                        </p>

                            Phoolan Devi's empowerment is always dependent on the males in the film, so she is empowered only when backed 
                            by the men around her. More pointing to a "recurring pattern in the film where she is rescued and empowered 
                            in the hegemonic male world of dacoits. Be it the depiction of her association with Vikram Mallah and being 
                            co-partnered as the head of the gangs of dacoits with Maan Singh. The male gaze projection of her relationship 
                            with Vikram Mallah conforms to the notion of subversion of her female agency by making her a woman of precise 
                            empowerment. At the same time, I am talking about the dominant masculine factors depicted in the film as a 
                            significant reason for her conversion of identity from a woman of victimhood to a woman of assertion and 
                            resentment. At the same time, I would like to bring out the constant deployment of the male gaze in the 
                            film towards her as a woman who is a widow and also belongs to the lower caste of the social hierarchy.

                            While Phoolan Devi failed as a biographical drama to represent the factual accounts of Devi’s journey as a 
                            dacoit, what it offers is a victimized Phoolan Devi who takes up arms due to repeated sexual assaults and 
                            abuse. Phoolan’s struggle is not just against her rapists but also against the upper caste men and local 
                            authorities who strip her of dignity. Therefore, as villains run loose, innocents are killed while the 
                            viewers are compensated with the joy of seeing Phoolan enter politics. However, there are no answers offered 
                            by the film regarding the overall safety and protection of women, and neither is there a debate on our social 
                            justice system. While Phoolan may be reckoned as a symbol of female strength in Indian films, hers is a 
                            personal battle as she does not offer any solutions to the widespread problems of women being treated as sex 
                            objects.

                            I have also argued how the collaborative projects between a colonized nation and colonizer can form such 
                            material consumption that fits the western world's gaze on the third world and its women. The making of the 
                            film was a brave attempt by Shekhar Kapoor to show the caste, class, and gender-based violence in post-colonial 
                            modern India. Still, the film fails to address the question of challenges faced by women in our social and 
                            judicial system for seeking justice against the violence they go through daily. Lastly, the film just left 
                            Phoolan Devi’s Identity as a victim of rape, leading to vengeance. At the same time, her personality has much 
                            more to be seen from the feminist perspective of making a woman through her experiences based on her caste, 
                            class, and gender.

                            This is the 21st Century but still, women continue to be underrepresented on a global and regional scale. 
                            To fully participate in public life and hold leadership positions, women must struggle against 
                            discriminatory laws, institutions, and attitudes. Inequality in access to the resources needed to develop 
                            into good leaders further disadvantages women. Both gender and age discrimination affects young women. 
                            Young women's capacity to realize their full leadership potential is particularly hampered by huge gaps in 
                            funding and resources for education, skill development, and mentoring. A life-cycle approach is necessary to 
                            support and strengthen girls' leadership, teenage girls' leadership, young women's leadership, and female 
                            leadership. We are aware that investing in the leadership of young women will alter not only their future 
                            but also their present.

                            India has had tremendous economic growth in recent years, with its GDP per capita rising from $375 to 
                            $1,572 between 1990 and 2015. However, such economic expansion has not been accompanied by advancements 
                            in assuring the equitable involvement of women in the economy. Compared to 96 percent for males, women's 
                            labour force participation rates (FLFPR) are far lower at only 27 percent. Due to varying estimates from 
                            many sources, including governmental organisations and university scholars, methodological disagreements 
                            have developed. However, given the global average of 49%, it is clear that there are not enough women in 
                            the workforce in India. The current study has found four key aspects that contribute to the explanation of 
                            India's low and possible fall-FLFP rate.

                                    There aren't many high-quality positions available because of the gender wage gap and

                            66 percent of the work performed by Indian women is often unpaid, compared to 12 percent of the work 
                            performed by males. This is a global trend since women everywhere are struggling to balance unpaid employment 
                            with children. According to the OECD, women in India labour unpaid for 352 minutes on average each day 
                            compared to 52 minutes for males. In India, women devote an average of 297 minutes a day to unpaid caregiving 
                            activities including looking after children, the elderly, and the ill. Men devote just 31 minutes per day. 
                            This is significant since studies have shown a negative correlation between the length of time women and 
                            girls spend doing unpaid jobs and their level of economic independence. For instance, a 2018 survey's findings 
                            revealed that girls' schoolwork and housework contribute to the gender gap in secondary schooling. At the same 
                            time, more than 40% of the males polled stated that they did not think married women who had good-paying husbands 
                            should leave the house. The hardship of unpaid employment is made worse by the belief that women shouldn't leave 
                            the private sector in the absence of financial necessity.

                        <p>
                            Although feminist ideals were proclaimed as far back as ancient China, they were not backed by a mature political 
                            theory until Mary Wollstonecraft's book promoting women's rights was published (1792). The so-called "first wave 
                            feminism" movement, which emerged in the 1840s and 1850s in response to the women's suffrage movement, was the 
                            first to widely popularise feminist ideals. But in the 1960s, "second wave feminism" appeared. In it, the 
                            increasing women's liberation movement's more radical and occasionally revolutionary demands were stated (WLM). 
                            Diverse feminist beliefs and ideologies all share the ambition to somehow improve the social role of women as 
                            their common thread. Feminism's fundamental tenets are, therefore, that society is marked by sexual or gender 
                            inequality and that this male dominance structure can and should be overthrown. Traditionally, feminist philosophy 
                            has been broken down into liberal, socialist, and radical schools of thought. Liberal feminists like Wollstonecraft 
                            and Betty Friedan recognize how women are treated less favorably in society because of the unequal distribution of 
                            rights and opportunities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The core of this "egalitarian feminism" is reformism. It is more closely related to the reform of the "public" 
                            domain, i.e., the improvement of women's legal and political circumstances as well as their opportunities for 
                            education and employment, than it is to the reorganization of "private" or domestic life. Socialist feminists, 
                            in contrast, frequently draw attention to the relationship between women's subordination and the capitalist mode 
                            of production, highlighting the economic significance of the fact that women are restricted to family or domestic 
                            life, where they, for example, relieve men of the burden of domestic labor, act as a reserve army of capitalist 
                            workers, and aid in educating and empowering the next generation of women.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, feminist criticism, which has emerged and is not a natural part of classic political theories like 
                            feminism, is largely to blame for the distinctive flavor of second-wave feminism. Radical feminists contend 
                            that the most important and basic divisions in society are those based on gender. According to her, patriarchy—an 
                            institution in which, to quote Kate Millet—"half of the population that is female IS governed by that half 
                            male"—defines all cultures, whether ancient or contemporary. Therefore, radical feminists advocate for a sexual 
                            revolution that will rebuild society in general and personal, domestic, and family life in particular. As a result, 
                            the radical feminism catchphrase is "personal is political." Radical feminism, which is frequently portrayed as 
                            political homosexuality, does not, however, advocate for women to leave male society or characterize men as 
                            "enemies," except in its most extreme forms. However, since the 1970s, feminism has evolved beyond the three 
                            categories of liberal, socialist, and radical traditions in many ways.

                            Though "new feminism" and "third wave feminism" are distinct from one another, they are both characterized by 
                            skepticism against the widely held objective of gender equality and a focus on disparities between women and men 
                            as well as among themselves.

                            further education, pursue a career, own property, occupy public office, and gain a profession.

                            Socialist Feminism: It is not merely a by-product of class that there is an oppressive connection between the 
                            sexes. It is necessary to break the link between sexual harassment and bullying in class.

                            By highlighting the so-called domestic labour performed by women, the capitalist system is kept in place. As
                            a result, the bourgeoisie and specific males both profit from women providing unpaid and individualized household services.

                            Some socialist feminists have examined the interplay between the family/private home sphere and the public sphere
                            of capitalism and governmental interactions. Differences between the private and the public foster unequal 
                            relationships between men and women in society

                            Radical Feminism: The material differences between men and women are what causes gender inequality. Natural 
                            power imbalances exist in biological families.

                            Similar to Marxism, which contends that monogamy was the only type of family that was not based on biological, 
                            but rather on economic factors: the exclusive goals of monogamous marriage were to predominate and reproduce a 
                            person in the family, as the future heirs of his wealth, children who were unquestionably his own. The only 
                            goal of monogamous marriage is to give the male sex priority over the female sex. To maintain control, they 
                            create institutions that recognize men's dominance over women and their capacity to dominate women sexually.

                            Males are the primary beneficiaries of patriarchal civilizations like those in the West, which are ruled by men. 
                            Forced heterosexuality assures that women are economically, socially, and psychologically dependent on males in 
                            a world where men and women hold uneven power relations.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The environment for business is evolving. Except for the COVID-19 epidemic, opinions regarding "conventional" 
                            corporate practices are evolving. Furthermore, there is reason to think that women will have a significant 
                            influence on this new industry. The term "women in business" alludes to the historical exclusion of women 
                            from positions of leadership, particularly in commerce, company, and entrepreneurship. These days, this 
                            expression promotes increasing the number of women working in business, enhancing workforce diversity, and 
                            advancing intellectual discourse. Women are represented more equally in corporate leadership roles and the 
                            entrepreneurial sector now than there were during the preceding period.

                            The development of firms, ideas, and products must be diverse, which requires increasing the participation of 
                            women in business. The growth of social networks and support that benefit women and their social surroundings 
                            are also facilitated by participation.
                        </p>

                            The idea that women should stay at home and cook, clean, and take care of the family has been a problem for 
                            women for generations. Women started to enter the workforce and find broad success in a variety of areas to 
                            increase prospects for equality and general life happiness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many people are unaware of how far back in history women's entrepreneurship can be traced. Around the northern 
                            Iraqi city of Asur, the first known businessmen first arrived in 1870 BC. Indicating that commerce was open to 
                            women at the time, Assyrian women frequently participated in the enormous commercial network that thrived in the 
                            area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are plenty more modern instances of women in business. For instance, before she became a business agent, 
                            Margaret Hardenbrook established herself as a debt collector before moving to New York City in 1659. She conducted 
                            business between Holland and the colonies and grew to be the richest lady in New York.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Contrary to popular belief, such tales are not as uncommon. Businesswomen traded in significant cities all over 
                            the world in the 18th century, and there are several cases of prosperous women entrepreneurs running and growing their 
                            firms. In 1766, Mary Catherine Goddard became the country's first female publisher; in the 1890s, Madame CJ Walker 
                            ran a million-dollar hair treatment company; and in 1913, Coco Chanel launched her first store. But when the 
                            workforce shifted in the middle of the 19th century, males began to get all of the salaries while women focused 
                            more on household responsibilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For instance, Katherine Graham was the sole female CEO of the Fortune 500 corporation in 1973. Only 38% of American 
                        workers at the time were women. This percentage increased to 46.2% in 2019, and there were 37 Fortune 500 businesses 
                        with female CEOs.The tendency for women to hold senior roles appears to be rising as more well-known companies, like 
                        IBM, General Motors, and Mondelez International, employ women for these positions. There are now more women working 
                        for Fortune 500 corporations than at any other point in the list's 63-year existence.

                        <p>
                            Around the world, there are huge differences in how women are treated in the workplace. The number of women-owned 
                            businesses has increased by almost 3,000% since 1972, according to the "2018 Report on the State of Women-Owned 
                            Enterprises," which American Express commissioned. Although society has made significant progress in promoting 
                            women in business, there are still issues with a lack of professional orientation, family obligations, gender 
                            discrimination, a lack of sufficient capital, inadequate education, and lack of access to or training in the use 
                            of technology. Women are constrained by their social and political surroundings more than males are.

                        <p>
                            Both industrialized and developing nations are seeing an increase in the number of women starting their businesses, 
                            and national governments are becoming more aware of this trend.Even though they make up 47.00% of all workers, 
                            women only make up 6.2% of CEOs in S&P 500 businesses. Despite making up 47% of the US workforce, controlling 
                            approximately 75% of family spending, and more than 50% of personal wealth in the country, women only make up 
                            20% of the S & P 500 directors as of 2016. With an average S & P Board 500 of 11 members, there are around 2 women 
                            on the board of directors. As of 2014, there were just 4.6% female Fortune 500 CEOs and 14.6% female senior 
                            executives. Women held 17.9% of the directorships on Fortune 1000 firms' boards of directors in 2015, which implies 
                            unequal gender participation on corporate boards. Although there are more women on the boards of Fortune 500 
                            businesses than there were a decade ago, the average growth rate is still barely a half percent each year. There 
                            are still no women on the boards of directors of one in nine companies on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, less than 
                            5% of the 22,000 worldwide enterprises had female CEOs, slightly over half had no female senior executives, and 
                            over 60% had no women on their boards.  Nevertheless, there are notable discrepancies across other nations: women 
                            made up at least 20% of senior managers and board members in Norway, Latvia, Bulgaria, and Slovenia, but in Japan, 
                            they made up only 2% of board members and 2.5% of senior managers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to the non-profit research group Catalyst, having a high proportion of women on a board of directors is 
                            connected with how well a company performs on four out of the six CSP (corporate social efficiency) indicators: 
                            supply chain, community, environment, and community. The diversity of corporate boards and charity contributions 
                            are positively correlated, according to Catalyst. The transition from the absence of women in corporate management 
                            (CEO, Board of directors, and other senior management positions) to the proportion of women in 30% is associated 
                            with a 1% increase in net margin, which results in a 15% increase in profit, according to a recent report by the 
                            Peterson Institute for International Economics. Over the next 20 years, millions of so-called "Baby Boomer" 
                            managers and executives are expected to retire, creating a predicted talent shortage. As a result, an increasing 
                            number of companies may view female leaders as an underutilized source of talent, experience, and leadership. 
                            However, a 2018 research found that, even when they perform their jobs effectively, female CEOs are 45% more 
                            likely to be dismissed than their male counterparts. According to a 2015 Ernst & Young and ESPN research of 400 
                            top female executives, there is a link between success in sports and business. More than 52% of senior managers 
                            competed in sports, compared to 39% of women in lower management positions. In high school, college, or both, 65% 
                            of the CEOs on Fortune's 2017 list of the most powerful women participated in sports.

                            Women's business cases have never looked better on paper. But the figures only provide a portion of the narrative. 
                            Women-owned firms are still in the minority, and the obstacles they must overcome to become entrepreneurs are 
                            significant and frequently dissimilar from those their male colleagues must overcome. Women in business encounter 
                            a variety of challenges. Some of the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs are the following:

                                Contravening societal norms: This may not be essential when talking about business difficulties with executives 
                                that are primarily male. In such circumstances, women could feel pressured to adopt a traditional "male" 
                                corporate mentality that is aggressive, competitive, and even unpleasant. Successful female CEOs, however, 
                                think that the secret to exceeding expectations is to be loyal to who you are and develop your voice.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Finding funds: Not all startup owners seek out advisors to assist them to launch their company, but those that 
                                are aware of how challenging the application process may do so. Capital raising is more difficult for 
                                women-owned enterprises. Less than 3% of venture-funded businesses have female CEOs, according to a Babson 
                                College survey from 2014.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Having difficulty getting attention: Most female CEOs eventually find themselves in a field or workplace 
                                dominated by males who are unwilling to acknowledge their position of authority.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Taking pride in your achievements: Encouragement of women's social and consensus-building skills may 
                                cause some of them to subconsciously doubt their value.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Establishing a support system: Since having a strong support system is crucial for entrepreneurship success, 
                                it is not unexpected that 48% of female founders say that their ability to advance their careers is 
                                constrained by a lack of mentors.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Juggling family and work life: To achieve this elusive work-life balance, entrepreneurial parents must 
                                discover methods to reconcile their obligations to their family and their businesses.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Overcoming failure fear: The road to success is strewn with setbacks, blunders, and failures, but it 
                                may still get you to where you want to go—as long as you don't lose sight of your ultimate objective.

                            <u>Women in Social Sector</u>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The duty of researching roles, equity, and justice for the profession and for society falls to social workers. 
                            "A social worker's job is to advocate for social justice in all facets of life, including real change for the 
                            betterment of the future." Women are leading the way in social work, a sector that is expanding, in defending 
                            women's rights. In approved social work universities, 74.1% of full-time instructors are women, according to 
                            CBRE's annual report for 2019.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In social work, males hold disproportionately more leadership roles than women, yet women still predominate in 
                            the field. Despite the fact that there are many more women working in this sector than males, MacPhail 
                            maintained that it is more accurate to refer to social work as a profession with a female majority that 
                            is controlled by men. This is a crucial point since the assertion that social roles are "dominated by women" 
                            implies that women have more authority only because there are so many more of them. It does, however, overlook 
                            certain crucial details. First off, by having fewer men in this field, men may potentially have positions of 
                            greater institutional authority. Secondly, careers in social work and other fields involving the care of others 
                            are undervalued. Third, it's going to be considerably more difficult to understand how power operates in social 
                            work organisations and how it connects to gender. One of the rare instances where gender is explicitly acknowledged 
                            is in the conversation about preventing harassment and discrimination within the philosophy and practise of 
                            social work. But they also frequently rely on incomplete reports. For instance, gender is referred to in 
                            Thompson's essay as "a basic feature of human experience, exposing the omnipresent collection of disparities

                            Eight close acquaintances are the average number of friends for American women. With an average of one to three 
                            such social relationships, rural women in India's states of Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttarakhand are 
                            substantially more socially isolated. According to nationwide surveys, 60% of women are prohibited from travelling 
                            alone to destinations including marketplaces, hospitals, and areas outside of their town. A quarter of husbands 
                            always want to know where their wives are, while a quarter of women are not permitted to visit their female 
                            friends.

                            Social networks are crucial, especially in developing nations with underdeveloped markets and institutions. 
                            Social networks are a source of information about things like informal loans, insurance, jobs, and rights, as 
                            well as medical services and technologies, such as those related to fertility and family planning, according to 
                            S Anukriti, an economist at the World Bank. "Social networks are an important and low-importance component of the process of economic and Human Development," Anukriti said. ”

                            In order to learn more about their social networks and how these networks affected their lives, a recent research 
                            of 671 married women in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh interviewed them. Each lady was asked to list a maximum 
                            of five individuals, aside from her husband and mother-in-law, with whom she might speak about personal matters 
                            and family planning-related topics. Only one such coworker was mentioned on average by respondents.This social 
                            exclusion may have a significant influence on women's chances and life decisions. This is particularly true for 
                            family planning, as just 19% of the women polled reported using contemporary methods of contraception despite 50% 
                            of them stating they did not want another child. Due to the limited number of social contacts, social networks can 
                            have a significant impact on the spread of new ideas and standards.

                            The majority of social professionals in the field are women. Both inside and outside of the profession, they 
                            encounter bias. The National Body for Women (NCOWI), a board-approved committee of NASW, was founded in 1975 
                            with the mission of creating, evaluating, and overseeing NASW initiatives that significantly address women's 
                            concerns. The objective of NCOWI is just as crucial today as it was when it was first established since there 
                            are still issues that oppress and disrespect women.

                            The founder of social work, Jane Addams, was the first American woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. He 
                            only affected women's opinions on social issues. Since Adams, social workers who support and campaign for 
                            women's rights have had to deal with issues such intimate partner abuse, human trafficking, gender bias/harassment, 
                            reproductive justice, and equal pay for equal labour. Today, "women's problems" are frequently restricted to 
                            concerns about their health and reproduction; nonetheless, practically every issue concerns women and calls for 
                            an intersex gender perspective. The profession must support coordinated responses as long as structural sexism is 
                            exploited to combat discrimination against women. Social workers are taught to research roles, equality, and 
                            justice with women who serve on a daily basis as well as in society at large.

                            In debates about preventing harassment and discrimination within the theory and practise of social work, gender 
                            is one of the uncommon situations where it is expressly allowed. However, they also frequently depend on 
                            inaccurate reports. For instance, Thompson describes gender as "a basic element of human experience, showing the 
                            omnipresent collection of inequities between men and women" in his article. There are other books that treat 
                            gender as a practise and stress its setting within the framework of late or reflex modernity, but this approach 
                            interprets gender notions at the level of attitudes, where it seems to just be a reciprocal attribute. Although 
                            attempts are made in social work to investigate how gender connects to concerns of racism, class, disability, age, 
                            or sexuality, gender is frequently viewed as a separate issue. Feminist care work, which promotes the idea that 
                            women shouldn't be required to take care of dependents, is an illustration of this. The work of feminists with 
                            disabilities suggests that the category of "women" includes those who are cared for, and these arguments put women 
                            and men with disabilities as "burdens" notwithstanding the importance of this issue addressing the effects of the 
                            state and family dependency on unpaid care. Others pointed out the imbalance of such debates on the purported 
                            heterosexual pair, as is common. The majority of feminist social work literature views gender as the cornerstone 
                            of equality and a shared objective. A common gender experience, "in the spirit of being a woman, is associated 
                            with men, children, family living, employment and working conditions," according to Hammer and Statham's book 
                            "Women and Social Work," for instance, develops what they refer to as "women-oriented practises" and contends 
                            that, given that women make up the majority of social workers and service users.

                            <u>Conclusion</u>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although there are several barriers to Indian women's full economic engagement, it is evident that the majority 
                            of them may be traced to societal conventions that limit their freedom of action and, as a result, prevent 
                            them from contributing fully to the economy. It is also obvious that in order to increase technological 
                            opportunities, current sociocultural norms must be considered. The integration of women into digital technology, 
                            banking, and the labour market is severely impacted by gender inequalities in education and skills, unpaid 
                            labour, lack of security, and restrictions on their freedom of movement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gender-neutral policies do not result in the same outcomes for men and women, according to current trends. The 
                            proliferation of gender stereotypes that lead to occupational segregation, uneven learning and skill development 
                            opportunities for boys and girls, as well as informal and unpaid employment for women, must thus be considered in 
                            policies aiming at expanding women's involvement in the workforce. In order for women to grow and take the lead 
                            in the economy, India also has to institutionalise the distribution of care labour between men and women, lower 
                            the gender wage gap, and actively seek to establish equal opportunities for them free from abuse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is essential to enhance the participation of women in leadership and administrative roles in the social 
                            sector since women have demonstrated that they are capable and successful leaders. It is feasible and doable 
                            to acquire the hard and soft skills required for leadership in this field. Invest time in developing the required 
                            abilities and establishing your formal and informal experience if you are interested in a managerial role.
